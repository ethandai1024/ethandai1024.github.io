I am currently studying group theory, linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, topology, number theory, and analytic geometry. 
There are a lot of beautiful concepts that I admire, and they are listed below:
Here is my favorite formula in topology: $$V-E+F=2$$
My favorite concept in geometry: Nine point circle
My favorite inequality in algebra: $$||A*B||<=||A||*||B||$$
My favorite probability distribution: Normal distribution
