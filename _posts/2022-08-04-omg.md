I am currently studying group theory, linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, topology, number theory, and analytic geometry. 
There are a lot of beautiful concepts that I admire, and they are listed below:
Here is my favorite formula in topology: $$V-E+F=2$$ My favorite concept in geometry: Nine point circle. My favorite equality in algebra: $$1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2=(1+2+3+...+n)^2$$ My favorite probability distribution: Normal distribution. My favorite combinatorial identity: $$C(2n,n)=C(n,0)^2+C(n,1)^2+C(n,2)^2+...+C(n,n)^2$$
