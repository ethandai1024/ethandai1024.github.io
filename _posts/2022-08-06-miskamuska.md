I am currently working on public forum debate, and I am preparing for the NHSDLC debate competition recently. I am the second speaker, and rebuttal speech is definitely my favorite speech in the debate, because first, you need to be creative to come up with spontaneous arguments, and also, you need sufficient evidences to back up your arguments and claims. As a junior debater, I have a lot of space for improvement, and I look forward to becoming a successful debater in the future.
