I am currently a member of an organization known as Mars Club. The objective of Mars Club is to move a group of pioneers to Mars. Our organization has 3 main departments: the project department, the merch department, and the coding department. Our recent projects include the gas pump rocket, and we are also working on a debate video about space myths. Follow us!
