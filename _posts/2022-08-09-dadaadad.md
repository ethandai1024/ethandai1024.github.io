For those of you who are interested in topics in combinatorics, I suggest you to take my course "count down". There are two phases, the beginner phase, and advanced phase. The beginner phase introduces some fundamental concepts and general ideas of counting, and the advanced phase focuses on using complex techniques to approach, prove, or solve counting problems.
